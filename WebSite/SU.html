          been credited with over 310 single kills, rivaling even the great Simo Häyhä. In June 1941, 24-year-old Pavlichenko was in her
          fourth year studying history at the Keiv University when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko was among
          the first round of volunteers at the Odessa recruiting office, where she requested to join the infantry and subsequently she was
          assigned to the Red Army's 25th Rifle Division; Pavlichenko had the option of becoming a nurse but refused; "I joined the army
          when women were not yet accepted". There she became one of 2,000 female snipers in the Red Army, of whom about 500 survived the war.
          In early August 1941 she made her first two kills as a sniper near Belyayevka, using a Tokarev SVT-40 semi-automatic rifle with 3.5X
          telescopic sight. </p></font></font></b>

              precision bombing missions against the German military from 1942 until the end of the war. At its largest, it had 40 two-person crews.
              The regiment flew over 24,000 missions and dropped 23,000 tons of bombs. It was the most highly decorated all-women unit in the Soviet Air Force,
              each pilot having flown over 800 missions by the end of the war and twenty-three having been awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title. Thirty of its
              members died in combat. Although the aircraft they flew, the Polikarpov Po-2, were obsolete and slow, the pilots made use of their exceptional
              maneuverability and they had the advantage of having a max speed that was lower than the stall speed of both the BF 109 and the FW-190, as a result,
              German pilots found them very difficult to shoot down. A technique used by the night bombers was to idle the engine near the target
              and glide to the bomb targets, with only wind noise capable of revealing their location. German soldiers connected the sound to broomsticks and named the pilots
              "Night Witches." Due to the weight of the bombs and the low altitude of flight, the pilots carried no parachutes. Out of the orginial 40 members,
            30 of them died in combat.</p></font></font></b>

          He was raised by the polish soldiers over the course of the war and served as a mascot for the company.
        He loved wrestling with the soldiers and was taught to salute when greeted. Wojtek became quite an attraction for soldiers
        and civilians alike and with the 22nd company, he move all throught the Middle East. In order to allow him to ride british transport ships,
        he was offically drafted into the Soviet Army as a private. he was given the same rations as the soldiers, and even loved cigarrets and vodka.
        According to numerous accounts, during the Battle of Monte Cassino, Wojtek helped by carrying ammunition – never dropping a single crate.
        In recognition of the bear's popularity,
        the HQ approved a depiction of a bear carrying an artillery shell as the official emblem of the 22nd Company.</p></font></font>
