            fought in the same war, they had not fought on the same side. Two had fought for the U.S. and two for Japan. Harry and Ken found
             the country in which they were born and to which they returned was
              becoming increasingly hostile to citizens of Japanese heritage. The two borthers were sent to an internment camp in colorado,
            where they were recruited by the US army. Unbeknownst to Harry and Ken, their younger brothers, Saburo and Shiro, were fighting
            diligently in the war as wellâ€”for the Japanese.
            The nature of military service of these pairs of Akune brothers were unknown to each other until a family reunion in Japan led to
            the revelation that the brothers had fought on opposing sides of the war. Ichiro, their father, quickly brokered a peace among his
            sons, and all four of the veterans returned to California and later fought on the same side (for the U.S.) in the Korean War.</p></font></font></b>

           ,the 477th Bombard Group (the first black bomber group) was also part of the Tuskegee Airmen. Th airmen were known for impressive skill, such as
         the fact that in over 200 total missions, they had never once lost an escorted bomber to the enemy, being a first in World War II.</p></font></font>
