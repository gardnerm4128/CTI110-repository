            harbinger of the holocaust, which resulted in the death of nearly 13 million. </p>

           the Japanese, the Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany, by the time the conflict was over Yang enlisted into the Japanese army as young as eighteen years of age,
           though not by choice.
            He fought for the Japanese for all of a year before the Soviet Union captured and imprisoned him. When the Soviet Union found themselves
            struggling in 1942, they required the Korean soldier to fight for them. He and a vast array of other prisoners
            found themselves fighting for the other side, but this again would not last long. He had another year-long stint in the military before once
            again being captured, this time by the Germans. By 1944, Yang was fighting for the German side. Again, those he fought alongside were predomi
            nantly other prisoners. He managed to survive until his eventual imprisonment by Allied forces. By that time, the war was close enough to over
            that the Korean soldier was not forced to fight any further. Still, he fought for three armies in a war that did not spare many men who only f
            ought for one. Even worse, he was never fighting for his own beliefs, but always for those thrust upon him.</p></font></font></b>

            armed with 280mm naval cannons and was to weight 1000 tons, making it the heaviest tank ever created. the design for the tank came from studying
          Soviet heavy tanks, which also gave rise to the Panzer VIII Maus, the current heaviest tank ever built, at 188 tons. The large size and weight would
          have rendered the tank unable to cross bridges at the risk of collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended
           speed was 40 kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire.
           Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transportâ€”no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great
           for existing tunnels.</p></font></font></b>
