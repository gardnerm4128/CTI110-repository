              The Japanese decision to attack the United States stemmed from two things, the oil embargo placed on them by the United States, and the desire for
            complete dominance over the pacific. The japanese casualites of war was between 2.5 and 3.2 million.</p>

          because he had no idea the war had ended. On December 26th, 1944, Onoda was sent to Lubang Island in the Philippines.  His orders from his commanding
          officers, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, were simple: You are forbidden to die by your own hand, whatever happesn we will come back for you. In October 1945,
          after another cell had killed a cow from a local farm for food, they came across a leaflet from the local islanders to them saying “The war ended August 15th.
          Come down from the mountains!”. He did not believe this, thinking it was a trick from the enemy. He stayed hidden for 29 years, until he was found by a college student
        in 1974.  </p></font></font></b>

            which by the end of the war had produced a legit death-ray prototype capable of killing at a distance of up to half a mile. The catch: The target had to stand
            perfectly still for five to 10 minutes, so this doomsday device would have been effective only against the extremely lazy. </p></font></font></b>

          <p><font size="6"><font color="White">During World War II, the Japanese were well known for using a menagerie of chemical and biological weapons,
          including an attempt to attack the pacific of the US with plague-ridden fleas. Of course, the battles Japan faced throughout World War II proved
          more challenging and riddled with problems, and the opportunities to use biological warfare seemed to fail at every turn. That didn’t deter Japan’s leaders,
           military experts, or Shirō Ishii himself. He had planned to use 5 I-400 submarines, each carrying 3 M6A Aircraft loaded with disease ridden fleas. His plan was approved, however,
         it was planned for septemer 22nd of 1945, days after the Japanese had surrended to the United States. </p></font></font>
